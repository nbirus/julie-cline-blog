  One of the best things that Florence has to offer is their food! You hear all the time that Italy has some of the best cuisine and that is so true! While I am abroad, my goal is to find the most authentic Italian restaurants and share them with you for your travels!

Before I get into more detail, you must first know about the Italian meals. When you go to a restaurant you will see that they serve two courses. The first course is typically pasta while the second course is meat. When you go out to eat, you are not required to partake in the second course, but you should try it at least once! I also recommend the bruschetta! Bruschetta is chopped tomatoes with oil on top of bread and it is absolutely delicious!

For our first meal out in the city we went to Osteria Antica Mescita. This little restaurant is located on Via di S. Niccol√≤, 60 r, 50125 Firenze, which is below the Rose Gardens and it has both indoor and outdoor seating. I should warn you that if you sit outside that they will charge you a small fee, but it is worth it because you can see natives walk by and see what is going on around you. I would also suggest bringing a bottle of water because they will charge each person a small fee for water.

Osteria Antica Mescita gives their customers nice sized portions, so it's great to share or save for later. For my meal I ordered a pasta dish with tomatoes and fresh mozzarella and it was fantastic! I would recommend this dish to everyone! I was talking to a native about this restaurant and they said that they have a different menu every day, so if you choose to return you might not have the same menu you got the other day. This is a great idea because it keeps the menu fresh and people are able to try different kinds of Italian cuisine.

When we went to dinner, we went to see the sunset and it was beautiful. The sunsets around 8:30pm-8:40pm in the summer and I highly recommend either eating before the sunsets or waiting to grab a bite to eat until after the sunsets.
