  Hi! I’m Julie!
---

If you told me what my life would look like ten dates ago, I would laugh and tell you that you were crazy. In college, I got the opportunity of a lifetime to travel the world, not once, but twice. Since college, I got married, and bought a house at the age of 23. What’s the secret you might ask? Having a really supportive family to help me through thick and thin.

Back in 2017, I created a blog to share about my travels abroad. It highlighted my secrets about what to see, what to taste, and what to experience while in Europe. That blog has now transformed into a place where I can still talk about traveling, but also a place where I can talk about my life lessons and curiosities.

I believe that my life should be defined by just that, living. Why? Because after you graduate, people assume you know what your life will look like. I was not one of those people...I didn’t have a job waiting for me after graduation and I was really worried about the next stages of adulthood. Plus, I am naturally curious about various things and am excited to explore them all. Through this blog, you will see me take risks that might result in failure, explore new things, challenge myself, become a parent, and many more.

Thanks for joining me on this crazy adventure!
